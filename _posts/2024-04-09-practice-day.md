Practicing a Chinese piano piece is like taking a journey into a different world. It is about paying close attention to every tiny detail and really understanding the music's special meanings. It is also about feeling the emotions and stories behind the folk music. With lots of practice and love for the music, it can be a special adventure where I learn and grow as a musician.

1. Practice a lot before the performance so you feel more confident.
2. Take deep breaths to calm yourself down.
3. Tell yourself positive things to boost your confidence.
4. Imagine yourself doing well before you start.
5. Focus on what you're doing right now, not on what might go wrong.
6. Try relaxing your body with techniques like tensing and releasing your muscles.
7. It's okay to feel nervous, so accept it and try to use it in a positive way.

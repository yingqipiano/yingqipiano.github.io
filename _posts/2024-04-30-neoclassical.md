Neoclassical music often includes some characteristics:
1. Clear tonality, but with modern harmonies and dissonances.
2. Following the basic traditional structures and forms borrowed from the 18th century, like sonatas, concertos, symphonies, and variations.
3. Objective, rather than overly emotional, expression.
4. Counterpoint reminiscent of Baroque music.

Example: Brahms Sonata Op.1

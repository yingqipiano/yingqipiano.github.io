This piece was composed in 1973. It is based on melodies from Eastern China. The original melody is played by a Chinese double-reeded instrument, Suona. It has a distinctively loud and high-pitched sound, and is used frequently in Chinese traditional music ensembles, particularly in the pieces that perform outdoors. It is an important instrument in the folk music of northern China, where it has long been used for festival and military purposes. Wang used the folk melodies and composed the piano version.
